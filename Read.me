SeedVR2 VRAM-Optimized Upscaling Workflow (ComfyUI)

This workflow is designed to give you the best possible SeedVR2 video upscaling settings based on your GPU’s VRAM.
Most tutorials only show default settings, but SeedVR2 behaves very differently on low-, mid-, high-, and ultra-high VRAM GPUs.

This repo includes fully tested presets for:

◼ Low VRAM (6–12GB)

Optimized FP8 model, small batches, and safe tiling settings for stable 720p → 1080p or 1080p → 4K upscales.

◼ Mid VRAM (12–16GB)

Balanced FP8 workflow with higher batch sizes and 768 tiling for clean 1080p → 4K results.

◼ High VRAM (16–32GB)

Full-precision 7B model with increased batch size and 1024 tiling for fast, high-quality upscaling.

◼ Ultra-High VRAM (32GB+)

Maximum-quality 7B Sharp workflow, full-frame processing, minimal overlap, and no tiling required.

Features

Fully tested VRAM-tier presets

Batch size, overlap, prepend, and tiling tuned for each GPU range

FP8 and 7B model support

Stable motion and minimal tile artifacts

Designed for ComfyUI and long video sequences

How to Use
